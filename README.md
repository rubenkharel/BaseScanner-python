 BaseScanner is made up of basic python programming with webscrapping on eyeball. BaseScanner can pull out some basic informations of the target such as user enumeration ,sub-domains enumeration and themes & plugins listings . We have used BeautifulSoup and Requests for webscrapping along with other python libraries so make sure to install the requirements before firing up the tool. 

#Pip Requirements 
1. BeautifulSoup 
2. requests
3. colorama

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rubenkharel/BaseScanner-python.git
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 BaseScannerV1.0.py
```

These library are mostly avilable in most of the python install. But, bs4(BeautifulSoup) might not be installed on somesystem. So if you stumble upon a error, just install bs4 with this command
"pip3 install bs4"
