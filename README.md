# BaseScannerxyz
 
 BaseScanner is made up of basic python programming with webscrapping on eyeball. BaseScanner can pull out some basic informations of the target such as user enumeration ,sub-domains enumeration and themes & plugins listings . We have used BeautifulSoup and Requests for webscrapping along with other python libraries so make sure to install the requirements before firing up the tool. 

#Pip Requirements 
1. BeautifulSoup 
2. requests
3. colorama

These library are mostly avilable in most of the python install. But, bs4(BeautifulSoup) might not be installed on somesystem. So if you stumble upon a error, just install bs4 with this command
"pip3 install bs4"
